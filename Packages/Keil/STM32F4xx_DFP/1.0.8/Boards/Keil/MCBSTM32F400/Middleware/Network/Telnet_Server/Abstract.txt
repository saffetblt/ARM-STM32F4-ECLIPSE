This program is a Telnet_Server example. It shows how to build a
simple IP based command line interface. 

Detailed description is available on:
www.keil.com/pack/doc/MW/Network/html/_telnet__example.html

Use this example to connect an evaluation board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the network
parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

If a DHCP server is not available, you may connect an evaluation
board to PC directly over a crosslink network cable. In this case
configure a PC to use a static IP address 192.168.0.1 and disable
a 'Dynamic Host Configuration' in Net_Config.c configuration file.
The default static IP address of this example is then 192.168.0.100

To test this example you need to run a telnet client on your PC.
If you do not have installed a special telnet client software, you can
run the Windows telnet client from a console window.

From the console window type:  telnet mcbstm32f400

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>

Type 'help' to see the available commands or 'bye' to disconnect.

The Telnet_Server example is available for one target:

STM32F407 Flash:
    Standalone application for MCBSTM32F400 Board.
    Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.
