When running the project, typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. ADC interrupt would be asserted once the conversion is completed. In ADC ISR, the conversion completed flag would be cleared by reading the conversion result value. Also, the conversion result value is stored, and the ISR counter is increased. These information would be printed when the execution return to the main loop.The point is that the ADC16 interrupt configuration is set when configuring the ADC16's conversion channel. When in software trigger mode, the conversion would be launched by the operation of configuring channel, just like writing aconversion command. So if user wants to generate the interrupt every time the conversion is completed, the channel's configuration with enabling interrupt setting would be used for each conversion.</description>

On the negative side, the internal 6-bit DAC is used to generate the fixed voltage abouthalf value of reference voltage.When running the project, change the input voltage of user-defined channel, then the comparator's output would changebetween logic one and zero when the user's voltage crosses the internal DAC's value. The endless loop in main() functionwould detect the logic value of comparator's output, and change the LED. The LED would be turned on when the compareoutput is logic one, or turned off when zero.</description>

      <description>The CMP interrupt Example shows how to use interrupt with CMP driver.In this example, user should indicate an input channel to capture a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the CMP's positive channel input. On the negative side, the internal 6-bit DAC is used to generate the fixed voltage abouthalf value of reference voltage.When running the project, change the input voltage of user-defined channel, then the comparator's output would changebetween logic one and zero when the user-defined channel's voltage crosses the internal DAC's value. The change ofcomparator's output would generate the falling and rising edge events with their interrupts enabled. When any CMP interrupt happens, the CMP's ISR would turn on the LED light if detecting the output's rising edge, or turn off it whendetecting the output's falling edge.</description>

      <description>The Power manager demo application demonstrates the use of power modes in the KSDK. The demo use the notification mechanismand prints the power mode menu through the debug console, where the user can set the MCU to a specific power mode. The usercan also set the wakeup source by following the debug console prompts. The purpose of this demo is to demonstrate theimplementation of a power mode manager. The callback can be registered to the framework. If a power mode transition happens,the callback will be called and user can do something. Tips: This demo is to show how the various power mode can switch to each other. However, in actual low power use case, to save energy and reduce the consumption even more, many things can be done including: - Disable the clock for unnecessary module during low power mode. That means, programmer can disable the clocks before entering the low power mode and re-enable them after exiting the low power mode when necessary. - Disable the function for unnecessary part of a module when other part would keep working in low power mode. At the most time, more powerful function means more power consumption. For example, disable the digital function for the unnecessary pin mux, and so on. - Set the proper pin state (direction and logic level) according to the actual application hardware. Otherwise, the pin cirrent would be activied unexpectedly waste some energy. - Other low power consideration based on the actual application hardware.</description>

      <description>The Power mode switch demo application demonstrates the use of power modes in the KSDK. The demo prints the power mode menuthrough the debug console, where the user can set the MCU to a specific power mode. The user can also set the wakeupsource by following the debug console prompts. The purpose of this demo is to show how to switch between different power modes, and how to configure a wakeup source and wakeup the MCU from low power modes. Tips: This demo is to show how the various power mode can switch to each other. However, in actual low power use case, to save energy and reduce the consumption even more, many things can be done including: - Disable the clock for unnecessary module during low power mode. That means, programmer can disable the clocks before entering the low power mode and re-enable them after exiting the low power mode when necessary. - Disable the function for unnecessary part of a module when other part would keep working in low power mode. At the most time, more powerful function means more power consumption. For example, disable the digital function for the unnecessary pin mux, and so on. - Set the proper pin state (direction and logic level) according to the actual application hardware. Otherwise, the pin cirrent would be activied unexpectedly waste some energy. - Other low power consideration based on the actual application hardware. - Debug pins(e.g SWD_DIO) would consume addtional power, had better to disable related pins or disconnect them. </description>
