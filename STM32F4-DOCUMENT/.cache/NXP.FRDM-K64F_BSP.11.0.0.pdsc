      <description>The adc16_interrupt example shows how to use interrupt with ADC16 driver.In this example, user should indicate a channel to provide a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the ADC16'ssample input. When running the project, typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. ADC interrupt would be asserted once the conversion is completed. In ADC ISR, the conversion completed flag would be cleared by reading the conversion result value. Also, the conversion result value is stored, and the ISR counter is increased. These information would be printed when the execution return to the main loop.The point is that the ADC16 interrupt configuration is set when configuring the ADC16's conversion channel. When in software trigger mode, the conversion would be launched by the operation of configuring channel, just like writing aconversion command. So if user wants to generate the interrupt every time the conversion is completed, the channel's configuration with enabling interrupt setting would be used for each conversion.</description>

The callback can be registered to the framework. If a power mode transition happens,the callback will be called and user can do something. Tips: This demo is to show how the various power mode can switch to each other. However, in actual low power use case, to save energy and reduce the consumption even more, many things can be done including: - Disable the clock for unnecessary module during low power mode. That means, programmer can disable the clocks before entering the low power mode and re-enable them after exiting the low power mode when necessary. - Disable the function for unnecessary part of a module when other part would keep working in low power mode. At the most time, more powerful function means more power consumption. For example, disable the digital function for the unnecessary pin mux, and so on. - Set the proper pin state (direction and logic level) according to the actual application hardware.

In this example, the adc16 module is initiealized by using VALT reference voltage, that is, VREF module provides a stable reference voltage to ADC16. Then, user should indicate a channel to provide a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the ADC16's sample input. When running the project, typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. The execution would check the conversion completed flag in loop until the flag is asserted, which means the conversion is completed. Then read the conversion result value and print it to debug console.</description>
